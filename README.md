# Incorrect Zero Handling in C# Method

This repository demonstrates a common error in C# where a method fails to properly handle zero values in its input parameters. The `MyMethod` function is designed to divide two integers, but it doesn't correctly account for the case where either `a` or `b` is zero, which would lead to division by zero exception. 

The solution provides a corrected version that addresses the zero handling to prevent exceptions and produce more reliable results.
